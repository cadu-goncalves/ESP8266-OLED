SSD1306 OLED I2C driver

Derk Steggewentz, 3/2015 

This is a I2C driver for SSD1306 OLED displays including graphics library.

The graphics library part (gfx_ functions) is a heavily modified version of the Adafruit graphics library,

No license restrictions on my part, do whatever you want as long as you follow the derived license requirements for the graphics library part.

Usage:


- Choose the 2 GPIO pins to be used for the I2C bus and connect the display to it and VCC/GND.

- Don’t forget to add pull-up resistors to SDA and SCL (something like 2.2k to 10k)

- configuration settings for these GPIOs are at the top of i2c_master.h, adjust to your choosen GPIOs

- in your code call i2c_master_gpio_init() before using any i2c devices

- the display needs to be initialized before it can be used via display_init(0x3c), (use the 7bit i2c address of your display)

Examples:



// clear display

display_clear();

display_update();




// draw a line

gfx_drawLine(0,0,60,60,WHITE);

display_update();




// text/line printing

gfx_setTextSize(1);

gfx_setTextColor(WHITE);

gfx_setCursor(0,0);

gfx_println("test line 1 ...");

gfx_println("2nd line ...");

display_update();    




//scrolling

gfx_setTextSize(2);

gfx_setTextColor(WHITE);

gfx_setCursor(10,0);

gfx_println("scroll");

display_update();    
     


display_scroll(SCROLL_PAGE_0,SCROLL_PAGE_7,SCROLL_RIGHT,SCROLL_SPEED_7);
os_delay_us(3000000);

display_stopscroll();


see ssd1306.h for the entire API


The file i2c_master.c from Espressif is slightly modified to allow higher I2C bus speeds. 100kHz I2C clock speed turned out to be a bit slow for the display. Use the I2C_CLOCK macro on the top of i2c_master.c to adapt the i2c speed to your needs.
